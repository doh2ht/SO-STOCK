    <div class="about">"Special Occasions" explores the normalcy of human society and the biased perspective of technology in an age where human-computer conversations have become commonplace. The story revolves around the most ordinary scene of human communication: a family of four sharing a meal. While these scenes are familiar, these moments are portrayed as special occasions in an idealized reality created by machines.

        In a world filled with surreal images, the work iterates on the process of creating the most ordinary and realistic images as represented by technology, and then tweaking them through the perspective of AI. This allows for the experience of subtle emotional shifts, from warm memories to feelings of alienation when technology attempts to accurately depict human society. It explores how technology shapes our perception of reality and the emotional dissonance it can create, emphasizing the unique beauty of imperfection that only the technology of this era can provide.</div>
